add simulation speed
✔ acceleration and velocity correctly update depending on d_time
✔ initial velocities scale correctly as n increases
✔ speed controller using keyboard arrows
    ✔ fix d_time
    ✔ take keyboard input from pygame.event.get()
    ✔ display simulation speed in top right corner


make collided planets' trails be drawn on behalf of system
✕ adjustable trail lengths
    ✔ flag description in --help
    ✕ flag description in README.md
    ✕ LENGTH variable passed through draw_planets(), draw()

fix/overhaul file loading
✔ arguments can be passed to main()
✕ override happens outside of func
✕ flags can be taken from terminal
